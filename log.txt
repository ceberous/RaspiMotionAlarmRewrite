This experiment explored converting an acyl chloride into a carboxamide. Diethylamine was used was the source of nitrogen, and diethyl ether (dry ether) was used as the solvent. The lone pair on the nitrogen of diethylamine acts as a nucleophile and is attracted to the partial positive charge on the acyl chloride funcional group of m-toluoyl chlroide. This gives an intermediate where oxygen temporarily beaers a full negative charge. During this phase, another mole of diethylamine grabs the proton off of the added secondary amine. After this proton is removed, oxygen can restore its pi bond with carbon, and kick off chlorine as a leaving group yielding the final product N,N-diethyltoluamide (DEET).

The product formed was N,N-diethyltoluamide. The experimental product was exposed to the infrared specturm, and absorption peaks were measured. The starting material contained a C-Cl functional group. As previously mentioned, the chlorine was displaced by an amine, and an absense of the C-Cl peak was visually seen at 694 cm-1. Likewise, the experimental product contains an amine group, while the starting material does not; a C-N functional group was visually seen at 1217.89 cm-1.

In comparing the identified functional group peaks of the synthesized product to the literature values, they all had a low percent error of less than 1%. It should be noted that DEET also contains a C=O functional group that would have been expected to be seen at around 1700 cm-1, however both the literature and the experimental product IR graphs do not show a clear peak in this region.

Comparing the starting material to the synthesized product's literature values for 1H NMR, we can see m-toluoyl chloride has 4 distict signals while DEET has 7. The starting material has to equivalent protons adjacent to the acyl chloride group. Additionally, the carbon chains on the nitrogen produce two different signals. These differences account for seven versus four peaks in NMR data.

The percent yield for my synthesized product was 63.0%. In comparison, the class average was 75.8%. This gives my results a percent error of 17.0%, a standard deviation of 0.363, and a normalization value of -0.355. The class overall had a wide range of yields. Some were much higher, some even exceeding the theoretical yield. One possible explination is some groups may have not boiled off the ether completely, while others boiled for too long. In a microlab setup, percent yields are always troubling to reason. Given the displayed possibility of other groups obtaining a higher percent yield, my percent yield may be considered acceeptable, but not good enough for industry standards.

The addition and subtraction of the appropriate functional groups, the low percent error of experimental to literature IR values, both support the conclusion DEET was successfully synthesized. Additionally, the difference from four to seven signals in the 1H NMR data give further evidence. My percent yield was on average to the class, with a 0.363 standard deviation. In conclusion, the acyl chloride groupu was successfully converted to a carboxamide, and DEET was successfully synthesized.
